---------------------

This folder contains all .hdl files for Project 5:
1. Memory
2. CPU
3. Computer


I confirm that I've successfully tested each of these, by running the .tst files in the Hardware Simulator and got the message 'End of script - Comparison ended successfully' for each one. Hence, it should have passed all tests provided. For the Computer chip, I tested with 'Add', 'Max', 'Rect' and for 'Rect' a small rectangle was drawn at the left top corner of the screen.
