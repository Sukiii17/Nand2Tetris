CONTENTS OF THIS FOLDER
---------------------

This folder contains all .asm files for Project 4:
1. Mult
2. Fill


I confirm that I've successfully tested each of these, by running the .tst files in the CPU Emulator and got the message 'End of script - Comparison ended successfully' for each one. Hence, it should have passed all tests provided. 

For the Fill.asm, I tested with 'FillAutomatic.tst' and 'Fill.tst'. For 'FillAutomatic.tst', 'End of script - Comparison ended successfully' is shown. For 'Fill.tst', I inspected by pressing keyboard and the screen is filled black top down. When the key is not pressed, the screen goes back to white bottom up.
