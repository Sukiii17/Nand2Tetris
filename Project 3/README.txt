CONTENTS OF THIS FOLDER
---------------------

This folder contains all .hdl files for Project 3.

In Folder a, there are files for the following chips:
1. Bit
2. Register
3. RAM8
4. RAM64
5. PC

In Folder b, there are files for the following chips:
1. RAM512
2. RAM4K
3. RAM16K

I confirm that I've successfully tested each of these, by running the .tst files in the Hardware Simulator and got the message 'End of script - Comparison ended successfully' for each one. Hence, it should have passed all tests provided.
