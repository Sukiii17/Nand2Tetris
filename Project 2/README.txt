CONTENTS OF THIS FOLDER
---------------------

This folder contains all .hdl files for Project 2:
1. HalfAdder
2. FullAdder
3. Add16
4. Inc16
5. ALU

I confirm that I've successfully tested each of these, by running the .tst files in the Hardware Simulator and got the message 'End of script - Comparison ended successfully' for each one. Hence, it should have passed all tests provided.

For the ALU HDL, I comment in the file. I also test with and without the status bits with ALU-nostat.tst and ALU.tst.

For the FullAdder, I provide two implementations and the second has a better ingredient of abstraction.
